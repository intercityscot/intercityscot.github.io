# intercityscot.github.io
This project is an archive of the last day that The Inter-city Scot was active.

It has been modified to work as a static website on GitHub.
* All PHP files have been converted to html files.
* All PHP "includes" have been included, thus rendering the _included_ files superfluous: hence, removed.
* The forms for submitting classes, groups, and events have been deactivated.
* _Clicky: Privacy-friendly Website Analytics_ has been removed.
